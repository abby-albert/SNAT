## Our project
We aim to create a "study buddy" for our passion project this year. As students at Del Norte, we have a lot to juggle and sometimes it can be overwhelming. With the help of the study buddy, it will allow us to input our schedules and get daily reminders, create flashcards to study with, and have study sessions with an AI.
